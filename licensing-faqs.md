# Licensing FAQs

1. Can I use EmojiBox for my open-source project?

  * Yes.

2. Can I use EmojiBox for my closed-source project?

  * Yes.

3. Can I use EmojiBox for my commercial project?

  * Yes.

4. What do you require of me to use EmojiBox in my project?

  * Basically, the only requirement I have is that, if you're using my code, you include a link in the compiled form of your application that links back to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/shine-calendar/EmojiBox/) or to [the Shine Calendar Tumblr](http://shinecalendar.tumblr.com). (Note that I may change the second link in the future.)

    * Other than that, you'll also want to attribute the Emoji One library that EmojiBox uses (such as *Emoji images provided by [Emoji One](http://emojione.com)*), and the Json.NET library that EmojiBox uses as well.

  * So, here's a quick paragraph you can copy and paste into your About box or wherever else it's appropriate:

    * Includes [EmojiBox emoji picker](https://github.com/shine-calendar/EmojiBox/) by Jacob R. Huempfner. Emoji images provided by [Emoji One](http://emojione.com). Additional emoji parsing code provided by [JSON.NET framework](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

5. What licenses do Emoji One and Json.NET use?

  * Emoji One, being an image library, is released under the [Creative Commons 4.0 license (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). It's a "lifetime non-exclusive non-revocable royalty-free license", according to their [website](http://emojione.com/licensing/).

  * Json.NET, just like EmojiBox, is available under a [MIT License](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

6. Is the MIT License GPL-compatible?

  * (Yes it is!)[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License]

7. If I have any additional questions, where should I contact you?

  * I can be reached on Twitter (@JaykeBird)[http://twitter.com/JaykeBird]. If you need to send an email, you can do so at shine-calendar@outlook.com.
